Facial Emotion Recognition
📌 Overview
Facial Emotion Recognition is a deep learning-based project that detects human emotions from facial expressions in images or video streams. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify emotions into categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

🚀 Features
Detects emotions from facial expressions in real-time.
Uses OpenCV for face detection.
Implements a pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification.
Provides visualization of predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning)
OpenCV (for image processing)
NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

📌 Installation & Setup
